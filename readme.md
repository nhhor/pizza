# Application: **Pizza is an Object**

##### By Noah Horwitz

###### _First published 2019-11-08_

## Description:
This project was made as part of a code review for Noah Horwitz, a student at _[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com)_, a vocational school for technology careers, based in Portland, OR. The project is designed to create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost, then use JavaScript constructors and prototypes to create that pizza and correctly calculate its price.

The fully deployed project is hosted on GH-Pages [HERE](https://nhhor.github.io/pizza).
